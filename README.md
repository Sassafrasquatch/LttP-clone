# LttP-clone
LttP clone originally created for an OOP class.

I do not claim ownership of any of the images in the game, and it is not affilated with Nintendo in any way, shape or form.
I recorded the music personally, but did not write it.

This was initially a team project for CSC335 at the University of Arizona that I ended up writing almost singlehandedly, so I'm
tossing it up here as an example of something I'm a little proud of. I wrote every class except MusicPlayer, buttonMaker, Window,
and GameView in their entirety, and I wrote >90% of Window and GameView. This was ~2 weeks of coding between and after classes.

JavaFX, Java 1.8.202
